## Overview
### Description
Prolific is an app that encourages people to become co-creators by allowing users to add to threads using snippets of text and short media to create a story in a finish-the-sentence style format.

### Possible Iterations
These aren't necessarily iterations I'll implement at FBU, but are possible future directions for the app.

**MVP**
- App contains some existing starter threads for now (e.g. sourced from famous quotes/famous  movie lines), which are displayed in the home feed.
- Users can compose and submit snippets to these existing starter threads to continue the story.
- For each starter thread, after a certain amount of time, all the votes are counted up, and the "winning" snippet is chosen.
- Once a winning snippet has been chosen, it is added to the thread and users can again repeat the process of composing and adding snippets to this updated thread.
- Use user analytics to rank threads & snippets (main complex algorithm for FBU)
    - Purpose?
        - (1) make sure app doesn't only promote latest, top voted, or popular threads/snippets
        - (2) fraud detection: counter abuse from voters (i.e. same users always vote for another user)
    - Have a class that locally and directly calculates some basic ranking (based on simple factors like votes, views, etc.) to rank what order users see snippets that have been submitted to a thread

**Iteration 2**
- Bringing in content creators! Users can now compose their own starter threads for other users to add to.
- Users can follow a thread to be updated when a winning snippet has been chosen to continue the story.
- Users can follow other users to be updated on when they create a starter thread
- How do you end a thread?: A user can mark a snippet that they post as an "ending-type" snippet. If that snippet gets chosen as the "winning" snippet, then the thread ends.
- Use user analytics to rank what order you see threads on your explore page (so that you don't just interact with the top interacted threads, but see new ones too)

**Iteration 3**
- Private threads - users can create private threads that is only visible to a group of people (like creating a private game room!), snippets can only be posted to these threads by certain people

**Possible future iterations?**
- Modify class that deals with user analytics to instead send out the data to some server to do more complex analysis (e.g. maybe we want votes from new, unique users that haven't voted for that particular user before to count more than habitual voters --> need a graph database)
- More gamification of the app
    - Users can set thread types to change the pacing of the thread's storyline - normal, speed-round, etc.
    - Temporary threads - have the option to make an entire thread deletable - anyone who submits to that thread will be notified that the entire thread is deletable
    - Users can collect points based on how many times their snippets have won?


### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Social
- **Mobile:** Designed to embrace the mobile experience.
    - Users can add to a story thread using multiple forms of short media, including text, photos, or time-limited video.
    - Push notifications: users will receive push notifications if users they're following have posted a new starter thread, if a thread they've contributed to has been updated, if their friends have started a new private thread with them, etc.
- **Story:** Finish-the-sentence style posting.
    - Users can post their own starter threads in the form of text and other short media... and other users can continue the thread with their own media!
    - Can form private threads with friends: invite a certain number of people to a story and the story will only be visible for that group of users to view and respond to.
    - Value: a continuous thread of creativity ~ users interact with content not just as consumers and reactors, but as *co-creators*.
- **Market:** People with a creative spark!
    - Core market: everyday creatives looking for a community
    - People who don't want to just passively consume media that others create, but actively become a part of that creative process.
    - If I'm able to implement the private group idea (which could be very complicated), this might become a game that works well for smaller social groups
- **Habit:** Encourages regular interaction
    - Content: new starter threads will continuously be posted by users themselves, which are then continued with snippets submitted by other users
    - Users who follow a thread will be prompted to return to that thread when a new winning snippet has been selected, even if the user doesn't regularly check the app otherwise.
- **Scope:** Core idea is clearly defined.
    - Although adding support for multiple forms of media and multiple types of threads will take time, even a stripped down form of the app will accomplish the core goal: co-creating stories with other humans :)
    - Core, simplified idea of responding to threads with snippets and choosing winning snippets should be feasible within timeframe.
    - Thread logic may get complicated?
    - Interacting with private groups will definitely be complicated.

## Product Spec

### 1. User Stories (Required and Optional)
(based on [FBU App Expectations](https://courses.codepath.org/courses/ios_university_fast_track/pages/fbu_app_expectations))

**Required Stories**

*Sprint 1*
- [ ] User can create a new account
- [ ] User can login/logout of app
- [ ] User can view starter threads, ordered by creation date, in their feed
- [ ] User can tap a starter thread to view thread details & navigate through snippets-so-far
- [ ] User can compose and submit snippets to the latest round of an existing starter thread (text-only first)

*Sprint 2*
- [ ] Before a "winning" snippet is chosen, user can tap the latest snippet in a thread to view the snippets that have been submitted for a round
- [ ] User can vote on a submitted snippet to indicate which one they want to win a round
- [ ] Create logic for choosing a "winning" snippet: after a certain amount of time, votes are counted up (if no snippets have been submitted, add more time)
- [ ] Setup user analytics to track user interaction with threads & snippets

*Sprint 3*
- [ ] User can compose snippets using images (ability to take photos in-app + upload photos through device)
- [ ] User can follow/unfollow a thread
- [ ] User can view threads they are following in their Favorites page
- [ ] Create MVP version of ranking algorithm: have a class that locally and directly calculates some basic ranking (based on simple factors like votes, views, etc.) to rank what order users see snippets that have been submitted to a thread
- [ ] Create logic for finalizing a snippet: maybe there are different types of snippets you can create - a "normal" snippet and a "final" snippet. Or maybe for each starter thread, there are a limited number of snippets that can be made and the story has to finish within that number of snippets.
- [ ] User can integrate account with Facebook SDK

*Sprint 4*
- [ ] Improve UI! Check that required UI elements are there
    - [ ] Make sure app uses gesture recognizers (e.g. double tap to like, e.g. pinch to scale)
    - [ ] Make sure app uses animations (e.g. fade in/out, e.g. animating a view growing and shrinking)
    - [ ] Choose/add external library to add visual polish

**Tier 1 Stretch Stories**

- [ ] User can compose their own starter threads
- [ ] User can see their profile page with their own threads/snippets they've contributed to other threads and a count of their contributions
- [ ] User can customize their profile
- [ ] User can receive notifications when their snippet is liked or a thread they are contributing to is added to
- [ ] User can post snippets using other forms of media as well (e.g. video, voice recordings - potentially a better format?)
    - [ ] Create custom camera view

**Tier 2 Stretch Stories**
- [ ] User can view other userâ€™s profiles by tapping on the author photo of a snippet, and see what threads they've created
- [ ] User can search for other users
- [ ] User can friend/unfriend other users
    - [ ] User can add friends from Facebook (or other social media!)
- [ ] Update Explore Feed
    - [ ] User can see recent, but also trending threads in Explore page
    - [ ] Users can search for threads by title

**Tier 3 Stretch Stories**
- [ ] Users can make threads private
- [ ] Users can invite other users to a private thread
- [ ] User can share threads to social media apps? Need to work out logic of how that works (unless it's only sharing a snippet)

## Schema 

### Database structure

**Firebase Cloud Firestore** is a [document-oriented database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model) that works well with [hierarchical structures](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#hierarchical-data) and is ideal for storing large collections of small documents.

**How it works**
* Data stored in documents, which are organized into collections
    * Each document contains key-value pairs
    * Documents can contain subcollections and nested objects, both of which can include primitive fields like strings or complex objects like lists.
    * How do you keep documents in Firestore lightweight if you have a lot of nested data?
        * Use subcollections to create additional collections within a document (can nest data up to 100 levels deep)
* It is *schemaless* - free to choose what fields you put in each document and what data types you store in those fields
    * Documents within the same collection can all contain different fields + store different types of data in those fields
    * Still a good idea to use the same fields and data types across multiple documents for querying purposes though
* Collections and documents are created implicitly in Firestore
    * To use a database, just assign your data to a document within a collection
    * If the collection/document doesn't exist, Firestore will create it

#### Users Document
Note: **bold** text indicates a collection, *italicized* text indicates a document
Rough draft! Will likely change as I understand Firestore better. [Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/structure-data)

        - *round 0* (contains initial starter snippet - do I need this?)
            - submissionCount
            - isComplete flag (if true, round becomes immutable)
            - **submissions**

### Models

1. [Users](#Users)
2. [Threads](#Threads)
3. [Snippets](#Snippets)

| Property | Type  | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| userId | String | unique id for author (default field) |
| displayName | String | user's unique alias |
| password | String | user's password |
| threadsFollowing | MutableArray of thread ids | collection of threads user is following |

#### **Threads**
| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| threadId | String | unique id for the thread |
| starterSnippet | Pointer to Snippet | the initial Snippet |
| isCompleted | Boolean | is true if the thread has been completed |

#### **Snippets**
| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| snippetId | String | unique id for the Snippet (default field) |
| author | Pointer to User | Snippet author |
| text | String | Snippet text by author |

#### Overview of actions you can take on each object

* **Users**
    * Can create a user - when registering
    * Can can read a user - when logging in
    * Can update a user - when modifying profile
    * Deleting user? Need to modify all their snippets' author property to be "deleted-user"

* **Threads**
    * Can create a thread - instantiate with at least one snippet in it
    * Can read a thread
    * Can update a thread - each time snippets are submitted, or chosen
    * Deleting a thread? - maybe threads can only be deleted on server-side, i.e. users don't have this ability in the MVP
        * Why this is tricky: you're co-creators - it doesn't make sense for one person to be able to delete an entire thread of snippets
        * Future iterations:
            * Maybe design app so it's not possible for users to delete threads? You can remove a snippet/thread's attribution to you, but it won't be deleted if it's permanently part of a thread with other contributors
            * Or maybe can add a setting for "temporary threads", i.e. anyone who contributes to that thread will be notified that their snippets may be deleted at any time

* **Snippets**
    * Can create a snippet
    * Can read a snippet
    * Cannot update a snippet - once it's posted, it's posted!
    * Deleting a snippet? No deletion for MVP
        * Future iteration: maybe users can delete a snippet - but users can only delete in the sense of removing attribution?

### Networking

Most likely using [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) for Users and using [Firebase Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) for Threads and Snippets. Using [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics) for ranking algorithm data.
